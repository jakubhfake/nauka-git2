            <p>Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young</p>
            <p>In a world of magnets and miracles</p>
            <p>Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary</p>
            <p class="p-end">The ringing of the division bell had begun</p>
            <p>Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway</p>
            <p class="p-end">Do they still meet there by the Cut</p>
            <p>There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps </p>
            <p>Running before times took our dreams away</p>
            <p>Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground</p>
            <p class="p-end">To a life consumed by slow decay </p>
            <p>The grass was greener </p>
            <p>The light was brighter </p>
            <p>With friends surrounded </p>
            <p class="p-end">The nights of wonder </p>
            <p>Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us</p>
            <p>To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side</p>
            <p>Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again</p>
            <p class="p-end">Dragged by the force of some inner tide</p>
            <p>At a higher altitude with flag unfurled</p>
            <p class="p-end">We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world </p>
            <p>Encumbered forever by desire and ambition </p>
            <p>There's a hunger still unsatisfied</p>
            <p>Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon </p>
            <p class="p-end">Though down this road we've been so many times </p>
            <p>The grass was greener </p>
            <p>The light was brighter </p>
            <p>The taste was sweeter </p>
            <p>The nights of wonder </p>
            <p> With friends surrounded </p>
            <p>The dawn mist glowing</p>
            <p>The water flowing </p>
            <p class="p-end"> The endless river </p>
            <p>Forever and ever</p>
